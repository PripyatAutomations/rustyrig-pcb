You probably want no part of this.
I'm learning KiCad by cobbling together some radio bits to hook to my USRP...

Eventually this might become a free standing transceiver for use with a host
computer for remote operation.

There is no front panel user interface, besides power LED and fault # LED
display.

Current experiment consists of the following bits:
* raspberry pi 4b 8gb running devuan 64bit
* radioberry v2 RF frontend
* the RF amplifier, filters, and antenna matching unit.
